# apple_sql_project
OBJECTIVE:
The aim of this project was to analyze the Apple retail store dataset consisting of over 1 million records from the year 2020-2024 using SQL.
Several level of Problems were solved using advanced SQL queries in order to get deeper insight.


DATABASE:
The database consisted of 5 relations:
1.Stores table
2.Products table
3.Warranty table
4.Category table
5.Sales table (Parent table consisting of over 1 million records)


ERD:
The Diagram shows the relationship among the various tables and their structure as well.

QUESTIONS:
1.Find the number of stores in each country
2.Calculate the number of units sold by each store
3.Calculate the percentage of warranty claims marked as "Rejected"
4.Average price of product in each category
5.For each store, identify the best-selling day based on highest quantity sold
6.Identify the least selling product in each country for each year based on toal units sold.
7.Calculate how many warranty claims were filled within 180 days of a product sale.
8.List the months in the last two years where sales exceeded 20000 units in the United States.
9.Identify the product category with the most warranty claims filed in the last two years.
10.Write a query to calculate the monthly running total of sales of each store over the last four years and compare trends during this period.
11.Analyze the product sales over time,segmented into key periods: from launch to 6 months,6-12 months,12-18 months and beyond 18 months.
+ other buisness related problems.

CONCLUSION:
Along with problem solving using advanced sql, query optimization was also done by creating indexes, in order to reduce the execution time thus improving the efficiancy and yielding faster results.
Various types of Joins,aggregate functions,cte's and window functions (like rank,sum etc) were used to analyze the trends and get a more comprehensive insight.
